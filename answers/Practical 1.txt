5. The tests all pass. They are not complete; the tests do not test for erroneous input, and they do not test for
   edge cases either.
6. The last element in a singularly linked list points to null, while the last element in a circularly linked list
   points to the first element. Singularly linked lists are referenced by their head, while circularly linked lists
   are referenced by their tail.
7. Use a linked list when the number of elements is unknown/variable, when random access is not needed, and when
   memory is not a concern.
8. Round-Robin processes: round-robin gives each process a certain runtime, before pausing execution and moving onto
   the next process. Circularly linked lists allow this process to repeat indefinitely, without the need to write
   extra code to handle returning to the start of the list from the end.
   Extra handles: a circularly linked list means that a reference to any node can be used to access the entire list.
   This is useful if a process needs to access a particular node regularly, while also needing access to the entire
   list.
