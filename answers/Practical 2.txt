2. Enqueue: Move everything from Stack 1 onto Stack 2. Add new element to Stack 1. Move everything from Stack 2 back
   to Stack 1.
   Dequeue: Remove the first element from Stack 1.
3. Move everything from Stack 1 to Stack 2. Move everything from Stack 2 to Stack 3. Move everything from Stack 3 to
   Stack 1.
4. We can extend this to support more bases by changing the value of the modulo/division operation (eg. num % 3,
   num /= 3). To extend past base 10, we can use non-numeric characters to represent high numbers (eg. hexadecimal)
